            Ah, the wonderful history of Dota...
            <br>
            This is an article that I?ve had a number of people request from me,
            and one that I was dreading to write. ?Why, my humble writer,? I hear you ask, ?what could possibly be
            terrifying about writing a history article??
            The answer is everything. Dota?s history, as with that of many popular mods, 
            is rife with arguments over who is owed credit for what pieces, who stole what, 
            and what came from where. Nobody expected that, in the decade after the earliest Dota-like games, 
            there would be development companies spending millions of dollars to create the purest and most fun
            form of the genre. Very simply, no one thought to record what happened when. 
            The best we can do now is look backwards and try to piece together the ancestry of the game
            that reached its current apogee in Dota 2.

        <h3>THE EARLY DAYS: STARCRAFT</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In 1998, Blizzard Entertainment released what would come to be the top selling PC game of all time,
            Starcraft. Included with this game were a host of map editing and creation tools called StarEdit.
            StarEdit was truly a fantastically fun piece of software. Unlike other RTS games of the time that 
            came with map creators, StarEdit contained a deep and complicated piece of scripting that it called 
            Triggers. This, combined with the then-unknown amount of customization of units allowed in the engine
            meant that it was a playground for anyone that wanted their hand at making a fun UMS (Use Map Settings)
            map, without having to learn the ins and outs of things like the Doom or the Quake engines. 
            Later that year, with the release of Brood War, the editor became even more powerful, 
            and people learned how to unlock StarEdit?s potential.
